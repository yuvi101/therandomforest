    <description><![CDATA[In the realm of biometric security, facial recognition stands at the forefront, offering a seamless and intuitive authentication experience. However, traditional facial recognition methods often rely on extensive datasets and complex algorithms, posing challenges in scenarios where data is limited. One-shot learning, is a relatively new approach that promises to transform the field of facial recognition. In this post, we will delve into the concept of one-shot learning and explore its application.]]></description>
